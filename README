AMGoldsborough fork of the ITensor libraries (Homepage: http://itensor.org/). 

This code was used to perform the simulation for the paper "Using entanglement to discern phases in the disordered one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Rudolf A. Roemer (http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/111/26004).

The base code is ITensor version 0.2.3 but with additional code written by AMG to support the disordered Bose-Hubbard model amongst other things. The additions to the library are:

/itensor/model/bosehubbard.h - Bose-Hubbard basis with max. 2 bosons per site
/itensor/model/bosehubbard5.h - Bose-Hubbard basis with max. 5 bosons per site
